1. The built-in data set "trees" contains measurements of the girth, height and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees. Use the function `data` to load the data set. Then, create a scatterplot matrix to determine visually between which of the three variables the strongest correlation seems to occur. To investigate whether your assumption was correct, plot the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient as a number for each pair of variables in the upper diagonal of the scatterplot matrix.  
To plot the matrix you may refer to the function `pairs`.

```{r}
# Solution of task 1...

data(trees)

# Function to calculate and print Pearson correlation coefficient
panel.cor <- function(x, y, digits = 2, prefix = "", cex.cor, ...) {
  usr <- par("usr"); on.exit(par(usr))
  par(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
  r <- abs(cor(x, y, method = "pearson")) # Calculate Pearson correlation
  txt <- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits = digits)[1]
  txt <- paste0(prefix, txt)
  if(missing(cex.cor)) cex.cor <- 0.8/strwidth(txt)
  text(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor * r) # Scale text size by correlation
}

# Create a scatterplot matrix 
pairs(trees,
      upper.panel = panel.cor, # Use the custom function 
      lower.panel = panel.smooth, # Use a smoothed line 
      main = "Scatterplot Matrix of Trees Dataset with Pearson Correlation")

# Print the correlation matrix separately for clarity

BICLUSTERING- SIZE 2 EXAM QUESTION (PROBLEM)
CLUSTERING WILL BE DONE COLOUMN VISE(ALL PEOPLE WHO PLAY GTA WILL BE ONE CLUSTER)


2. Below you can find a data table that shows which students are playing which video games in their free time. Determine whether there are clusters of students playing the same games by using Biclustering (you may refer to the library `biclust`). Display two Heatmaps to inspect the results: The first heatmap should display the original data, i.e., which students play which games. The second heatmap should display which table cell belongs to which bicluster by giving the cells corresponding fill colors. Which visual problem occurs in the second heatmap?  
Note: If you use `biclust`, you can extract the associations of the games and student names to the different clusters from the result object via `result_obj@NumberxCol` and `result_obj@RowxNumber`.

INC / DEC THE BIN SIZE 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE BIN SIZE IS INC/DEC? - WHAT IS BETTER TO VIEW PEAKS ETC.?

3. For the 2D point data set given below, determine visually how many modes, i.e., peaks, the distribution of the points has. To do so, draw a standard scatterplot as well as a Hexbin scatterplot. Which one allows to answer the question better? How does changing the visual parameters help you in answering the question?  
For plotting you may refer to the package `hexbin`.
